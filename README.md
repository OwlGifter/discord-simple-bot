There are two bots in these files, one is called artbot and the other is called actualbot, ironically the main one used and implemented
as well as more efficient is artbot, and actualbot is the prototype made with the sole purpose of learning to use the discord library
this is my first attempt at creating a discord bot and it was successful, im sure more improvements can be made, but as stated earlier
this bot was created to fulfill a request, as such since the usage will be limited and not used frequently, i believe this will be enough
for the completion of the request, below are some examples of the bot while running:
